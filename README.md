# Social Network API

## Description

This project is a social network API built with MongoDB, a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data. The API is designed for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

The motivation behind this project is to understand and implement the technologies that social networking platforms use in their full-stack applications. This project solves the problem of handling large amounts of unstructured data in a social media application.
